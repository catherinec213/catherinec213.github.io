    <P>I am in the sorority <b>Alpha Delta Pi</b>. It was the first organization that I joined when I came to UGA and love being a part of it! As a member of this sorority, I work very hard to support and raise money for the Ronald McDonald house, which is the sorority's national philanthropy. The Ronald McDonald houses help provide homes for families with sick children while they undergo treatment in big cities, such as Atlanta. The goal is to make these families feel as comfortable as possible and to help them save money. Check out the <a href="http://www.rmhc.org/about-us">Ronald McDonald House Charities!</a> </P>

    <P>I am also involved in a number of organizations aside from my sorority. I am a RMIN and International Business major with a minor in Spanish and a certficate in legal studies. I hope to go to law school and eventually work for the General Counsel of a large corporation. I am a member of the UGA Moot Court team, a writer for the Georgia Political Review (GPR), and a volunteer mentor at Clarke Middle School. I also work as a barre instructor. Clearly I have a very busy schedule! I have provided a glimpse into my average week in the table below.</P>
